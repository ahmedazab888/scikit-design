    A 2 by 2 crossover design's effects can be decomposed into treatment,

    a crossover effect is given by:

    :math:`H_{0}: \\gamma = 0` vs
    :math:`H_{0}: \\gamma \\ne 0`

    where :math:`\\gamma` is the sum of the carry over effects.

    Attributes:

        alpha: The :math:`\\alpha` level required by the hypothesis.
        beta: The :math:`\\beta` level required by the hypothesis (equal to
            :math:`1 - power`).
        power: The power required by the hypothesis (equal to
            :math:`1 - \\beta`).
        p_11: The proportion with effect for treatment 1 in period 1
        p_12: The proportion with effect for treatment 1 in period 2
