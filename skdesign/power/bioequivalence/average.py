class Average(TwoSampleCrossover):
    """ Power and Sample Size calculations for tests of average bioequivalence.

    This class calculates the power and sample size for testing Average
    Bioequivalence using a two-sequence, two-period crossover design.  The
    hypothesis thus is the same as an equivalence test using the
    TwoSampleCrossover class.

    Attributes:
        n: The sample size required to test the hypothesis at an
            :math:`\\alpha` level and a power of :math:`1 - \\beta`.
        delta: :math:`\\delta` is the average bioequivalence
        sigma: :math:`\\sigma` is the standard deviation of the sample.
        known_stdev: A boolean indicator if the standard deviation
        alpha: The :math:`\\alpha` level required by the hypothesis.
        beta: The :math:`\\beta` level required by the hypothesis (equal to
            :math:`1` - power).
        power: The power required by the hypothesis (equal to
            :math:`1 - \\beta`).
