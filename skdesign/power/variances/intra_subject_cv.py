    """ Hypotheses for a testing the equality of Intra-Subject CVs

    There two types of models that can be used: a simple random effects model
    and a conditional random effects model.  The test is the same as a one
    sample test of means with :math:`\\mu=CV_{T}` and :math:`\\mu_{0}=CV_{R}`
    where :math:`CV_{T}` and :math:`CV_{R}` are the CVs for the two treatments.

    For a conditional random effect model, the standard deviations of the
    treatments must be stated.  For a simple random effects model, they are
    calculated from the CVs.

    Attributes:
        n: The sample size
        alpha: The :math:`\\alpha` level required by the hypothesis.
        beta: The :math:`\\beta` level required by the hypothesis (equal to
            :math:`1 - power`).
        power: The power required by the hypothesis (equal to
            :math:`1 - \\beta`).
        stdev_t: The variance of the first treament.
        stdev_r: The variance of the second treamment.
