class TwoSampleCrossover(TwoSampleCrossoverMeans):
    """ Hypotheses for a two sample test of proportions under large sample
        theory and a parallel design.

    The Two Sample Test of Means for Crossover Studies covers three hypothesis:
    equality, superiority, and equivalence.  Let :math:`\\epsilon` be the
    difference between the proportions of interest.

    The test for equality tests :math:`H_{0}: \\epsilon=0` versus
    :math:`H_{1}: \\epsilon \\ne \\mu_{0}`.

    The test for superiority tests :math:`H_{0}: \\epsilon > 0` versus
    :math:`H_{1}: \\epsilon \\le 0`.

    The test for equivalence tests :math:`H_{0}: \\epsilon \\ne 0` versus
    :math:`H_{1}: \\epsilon=0`.

    Attributes:
        n: The sample size
        alpha: The :math:`\\alpha` level required by the hypothesis.
        beta: The :math:`\\beta` level required by the hypothesis (equal to
            :math:`1 - power`).
        power: The power required by the hypothesis (equal to
            :math:`1 - \\beta`).
        epsilon: The estimated difference between the probabilities
        stdev: :math:`\\sigma_{d}`, estimated as is as in Chow (section 4.4)
